# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built with **Streamlit**. It scrapes movie data from **IMDb**, processes user reviews, and provides personalized movie recommendations using two recommendation algorithms:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies similar to a given one based on attributes like genre, director, and cast.
- **Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)**: Recommends movies based on user reviews and preferences.
